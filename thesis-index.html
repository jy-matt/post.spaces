						"It is likely that in the near future, a large number of people will be spending a
						considerable amount of time 'inside' such worlds. If we are to live - even partially - 'inside'
						these worlds, we must consider their architecture. The nature of space in VEs, however, is
						fundamentally different from the
						nature of real space and consequently the architecture of VEs will require a new theory and
						practice." - Bourdakis & Charitos, 1999

					<h2>CONCEPT</h2>

					<h3>Architecture and Virtual Environments</h3>
					<p>
						Despite the fact that virtual environments (VEs) have been around for more than 20 years and
						there has been continued research into their design and implementation, they have been regarded
						largely as entertainment and as
						<b>accessories to physical interaction</b>. In the midst of the post-digital revolution and the
						ongoing
						pandemic, we are increasingly looking at VEs as <b>substitutes</b> for real-life interaction,
						whether it be for social reasons,
						education, work, or leisure.
					</p>
					<p>
						In that light, it is more important than ever to consider the design of virtual spaces in
						<b>relation to the human experience</b>. Within virtual environments, traditional architectural
						conceptions of scale, spatiality, movement,
						framing and interaction take on vastly different forms, yet designing virtual space is left
						largely to the purview of software developers, concept artists and game designers. Given the
						<b>increasingly prevalant role of virtual
							environments</b> in our daily lives, as well as the emergence of new technologies such as
						<b>VR and AR</b>,
						the spatial design of VEs deserves to be <b>examined through an architectural lens</b>.
					</p>

					<p class="quote">
						"Architects need to start thinking about virtual reality as not just a tool, but as
						an end medium in itself." - Brett, 2015

					<h2>Desire for Physicality</h2>
					<p>
						Virtual communication platforms can be assessed on a <b>spectrum of spatiality and modes of
							interaction</b>, from collaborative documents, text chat, virtual whiteboards, voice chat,
						or video
						chat, to more fully featured environments
						such as 2D, isometric, or 3D game-like simulations, or even fully VR platforms. Especially in
						most of the non-spatial platforms, most would agree that something is lost when transitioning
						from the physical to the virtual.
						Without people and items occupying a physical space, the perception of meetings and events is
						changed. In the digital realm, out of sight often means out of mind.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within these virtual platforms there is an obvious desire for some form of <b>tangibility and
							sense
							of space</b>. How do we design virtual spaces conducive to interaction that aren't just
						carbon
						copies of physical space?
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>What are the different rules that govern spatial interaction in virtual environments?</li>
						<li>
							In what ways can we take advantage of virtual platforms to go beyond replicating the

							Can virtual environments take on a less detailed / more abstracted form, yet offer a
							satisfying level of spatial and physical immersion?

					<h2>PLATFORM</h2>

						There are two possible mediums for the exploration of virtual environments - a "web app" or

						user entirely within the 3D space. After some background research and testing, I have decided to

						</li>
						<li>

					<h3>Educational Focus</h3>
					<p>
						In order to limit the scope of the project and work towards a more defined goal, I have decided
						to focus on
						the design of <b>learning environments</b>. That is, any usage which involves <b>multiple
							actors</b> as well as the need to
						<b>impart knowledge through the use of multimedia</b>. This would target two of the three
						functions of virtual space as outlined above.
					</p>
					<p>
						Such learning environments would include archetypes such as classrooms, lectures, conferences,
						groupwork, study spaces and so on.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>PRECEDENT</h2>
					<p>
						The application of Architecture in virtual environments has been studied since the late 90s with
						the advent of rudimentary 3D graphics.
						However, the virtual world as we now understand it has a clear precursor - Cinema - which
						theorists and filmmakers have already studied in depth since the early 20th Century.
					</p>

					<h3>Architecture and Film</h3>
					<p>
						Cinema as a series of framed experiences - drawing from the heritage of the Greek picturesque in
						Architecture. Every experience within the virtual environment is necessarily framed by the
						boundaries of the screen space, making
						the curation of views and angles even more important.
					</p>
					<p>
						Within film as well as virtual environments, spatial perception is bounded by the <b>
							screen
							space
						</b>. It is impossible to 'feel' the space around you without actively looking up or
						around. What are the implications of space-creation under these constraints?
					</p>
					<p>
						Architecture as an <b>inattentive</b> form of viewing, whereas Cinema involves <b>attentive</b>
						viewing. In a way, VEs lie somewhere between the two - there is a conscious attention devoted to
						experiencing the virtual
						environment, yet with enough exposure the environment is likely to fade into the background as
						well.
					</p>

					<h3>Virtual Environment Design</h3>
					<p>
						Virtual environments have in fact been studied for over 20 years, with papers examining the
						various aspects of VE design in early 3D environments. I am currently in the process of
						conducting exhaustive
						research on the available literature, to see what can be applied to current issues, what
						frameworks can be adapted or referenced, as well as what issues might already have been
						investigated.

					<h2>CAADRIA ABSTRACT</h2>
					<p>
						In recent years, the use of virtual reality (VR) using Head Mounted Displays (HMDs) has become
						more accessible and widespread, with diverse applications in fields such as education,
						entertainment, and industry. Immersion in a 3D virtual space is a compelling means by which we
						can not only experience simulated environments, but also enhance virtual interactions beyond
						regular forms of online communication such as text and video.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are increasingly looking at virtual platforms as
						substitutes to for real-life interaction. Although much has already been written about the
						spatial design of non-VR virtual environments (Charitos, 1997), the spatial design of VR
						environments remains relatively unstudied. Given this increasing potential of virtual
						environments in our daily lives, the design of VR environments warrants closer examination
						through an architectural lens (Brett, 2015).
					</p>
					<p>
						Thus far, <b>the design of most VR environments has tended towards imitative environments that
						mimic physical spaces</b> – in fact, there is often an emphasis on physical cues and architecture to
						make users feel at ease within the virtual environment, reminiscent of skeuomorphic design
						during the earlier years of the digital era (Norman, 2013).
					</p>
					<p>
						Yet, <b>novel modes of seeing, moving, and hearing within the virtual space present an opportunity
						to move beyond the limitations of the real-world</b>. We refer to these novel modes as virtual
						physics, in contrast to the laws of physics in the real world, which we refer to as real
						physics.
					</p>
					<p>
						For VR spaces that aspire to support effective peer-to-peer human interactions, slavishly
						adhering to real physics can be frustrating. However, discarding all real physics can also be
						highly disorientating. The divergence between real and virtual physics therefore needs to be
						critically analyzed in relation to the affordances provided for supporting peer-to-peer
						interactions.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this paper, we undertake a critical review of the divergence between real and virtual physics
						within various popular VR environments used for games, entertainment and socializing, with a
						focus on the supporting peer-to-peer interactions.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based on this review, a taxonomy of virtual physics have been distilled, relating to how seeing,
						moving, and hearing in these environments diverges from the real world. Each of the rules are
						analyzed. A novel type of virtual environment is then hypothesized, incorporating the rules and
						design features that are seen to be most effective in supporting overall goal of peer-to-peer
						interactions between people in the virtual space.
					</p>
					<p>
						In order to test the hypothesis, a series of multi-user virtual environments were developed in
						Unity 3D, incorporating differing combinations of the proposed virtual physics. Small groups of
						five participants were asked to complete various tasks requiring peer-to-peer interaction and
						communication. Two groups of participants were tested. In the first group, participants already
						knew each other while in the second group, the participants had never met before.
					</p>
					<p>
						The experiments with the groups of participants demonstrated that the proposed virtual physics
						has a positive impact on the peer-to-peer interactions, for both groups of participants. The
						paper concludes with a series of recommendations for subsequent areas of research exploration.

					<h2>THESIS OUTCOMES</h2>
					<p>
						The final thesis outcome will be an <b>interactive platform for learning</b> that allows users
						to construct their own virtual environments, conforming to the principles highlighted by the
						earlier investigations. The use of these constructed environments would range from the temporal
						(meeting rooms) to the semi-permanent (classrooms, museums, conferences), as well as suiting
						groups of various sizes such as personal discussions, small groups, or large lecture settings.
					</p>
					<p>
						The aim would be to make the experience as user-friendly as possible, with parametric rules and
						algorithms
						governing the creation and adjustment of spaces according to the <b>kit-of-parts approach</b>
						from earlier research.
					</p>

				<div class="section">
					<h3>Initial App Concept</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>
							Users choose from a set of pre-made environments or create their own within an intuitive,
							front-end editor interface.
						</li>
						<li>
							Users 'playtest' their environment to see if it suits their needs - aim for minimal
							playtesting due to intended ease of use and modularity.
						</li>
						<li>Resulting virtual environment can be used by multiple participants for learning and

						<b>selecting from a library of topologies</b> and <b>controlling the parameters</b> of the
						virtual space?
						If all the spaces are dynamically generated according to function and capacity, there is no need
						for the user to build environments by hand. The resulting spaces might be <b>dynamic</b>,
						reshaping
						themselves according to the needs of the participants. Spatial relationships between users as
						well as between 'rooms' might be fluid or obey different hierarchies in the virtual space.

					<h2>TIMELINE</h2>
					<p>As the project comprises multiple stages with different moving parts (concept, design, tech), I
						have split up the project timeline according to the semesters as well as the deadlines for the
						CAADRIA paper submission.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="section-flex">
					<div class="inner-flex">
						<h3>Semester 1</h3>
						<p>Finish comprehensive research of existing literature and conduct study on parameters for
							spatial design. Iterate various spaces and environments, developing guidelines for virtual
							environment design and creating a 'kit-of-parts' approach.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="inner-flex">
						<h3>December Break</h3>
						<p>Focus on platform development and honing skills, build a foundation for final app/virtual
							environment product. Revise CAADRIA paper if necessary.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="inner-flex">
						<h3>Semester 2</h3>
						<p>Design work - using the earlier research and design strategies, develop the final platform
							with a focus on user experiences and perception of space. Iterative design process as with a
							typical architectural design project.</p>

					<h2>REFERENTIAL SPATIALITY</h2>
					<p>
						Most VR apps appear to have a richly detailed physical space as an anchor for users, likely to
						orientate them to the unfamiliar environment in the same way that skeumorphic design serves to
						acclimatise new digital users. Possibility of using such spaces as 'hubs' or anchors, while
						specialised rooms might be more abstract.
					</p>
					<h3>VR Hubs</h3>
					<ul class="list-minus">
						<li>Windows Mixed Reality</li>
						<li>AltspaceVR</li>
						<li>SteamVR</li>
						<li>VRChat</li>
					</ul>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>REPRESENTATION</h2>
					<p>Representations of objects, data and links are entirely spatial, taking the form of floating
						windows or interactable 3D objects. The ability to manipulate objects also helps greatly with
						the sense of immersion in the virtual environment.
				</div>
				<div class="media-section">
					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/VR_5.jpg"></div>
					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/VR_6.jpg"></div>
				</div>
				<div class="section">
					<h2>NAVIGATION</h2>
					<p>Another major consideration in the design of spaces would be the facilitation of interaction
						between participants. Again, the conception of what is 'human scale' and distance is uncertain
						in the virtual environment.</p>
					<h3>Room-Scale</h3>
					<p>Walking or room-scale navigation provides the greatest immersive capacity, however it can also be
						more tiring and stressful for participants. The space requirement for room-scale navigation is
						also not necessarily accessible.</p>
					<h3>Controller</h3>
					<p>Controller movement scores fairly high on immersion and is easy to use, however it has a
						propensity to induce motion-sickness especially if you are not used to it.</p>
					<h3>Teleportation</h3>
					<p>Teleportation is the easiest and most convenient, however it scores lowest for immersiveness.</p>

					<h2>Research Report Brief</h2>
					<p>The Architectural Design Research Report is an A4 hardcopy and PDF compendium that would capture research, design and presentation materials on the student's design thesis. This report should <b>build and elaborate on a body of evidence through creative practice research</b>, using writing, images, and diagrammes. The following should be included in the report:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Title of Research</li>
						<li>Research Abstract (300 words)</li>
						<li>Research Approach</li>
						<li>Research Context and Community of Practice</li>
						<li>Research Outputs</li>
						<li>Contribution to Knowledge</li>
						<li>Annotated Bibliography and Review of Literature, Works, and References</li>
						<li>Image/Resource Index</li>
						<li>Self-Disclosure of Research</li>
						<li>Ethics Approval as necessary</li>
