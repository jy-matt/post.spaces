						"It is likely that in the near future, a large number of people will be spending a

					<h2>CONCEPT</h2>

					<h3>Architecture and Virtual Environments</h3>
					<p>
						Despite the fact that virtual environments (VEs) have been around for more than 20 years and
						there has been continued research into their design and implementation, they have been regarded
						largely as entertainment and as accessories to physical interaction. More recently, virtual
						reality through the use of <b>head-mounted displays (VR)</b> has introduced yet another way in
						which such virtual environments might be experienced. While VR remains somewhat of a niche
						market, improvements in technology and accessibility in recent years has made it increasingly
						accessible to the average consumer.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the midst of the post-digital revolution and the ongoing pandemic, we are increasingly
						looking at VEs as <b>substitutes for real-life interaction</b>, whether it be for social
						reasons, education, work, or leisure. Thus far, the design of most VR environments has tended
						towards <b>imitative environments</b> that mimic physical spaces – in fact, there is often an
						emphasis on physical cues and architecture to make users feel at ease within the virtual
						environment, reminiscent of skeuomorphic design during the earlier years of the digital era.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, within virtual environments, traditional architectural conceptions of <b>scale,
						spatiality, movement, framing and interaction</b> take on vastly different forms. While the
						architectural conventions of the real world might be comforting, it is clear that the spatial
						design of spaces in virtual reality warrants a <b>critical re-examination</b> of its foundations.
					</p>

					<h2>Thesis</h2>
					<p>
						In this thesis, I hypothesize that by <b>moving beyond conventional, real-world preconceptions of
						physics and spatial configuration</b>, the design of virtual environments can be made <b>more efficient
						and
						comfortable</b> for users, especially for the purposes of peer-to-peer interaction.
					</p>
					<p>
						How do we design virtual spaces conducive to interaction that aren't just carbon copies of
						physical
						space?
					</p>

					<ol>
						<li>What are the different rules that govern spatial interaction in virtual environments?</li>
						<li>
							In what ways can we take advantage of virtual platforms to go beyond replicating the
							physical?
						</li>
						<li>
							Can virtual environments take on a less detailed / more abstracted form, yet offer a
							satisfying level of spatial and physical immersion?
						</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>Research Approach</h2>
					<p>While the project remains in progress and many of these efforts have been taken in parallel, the
						core
						of the research methodology can be traced in a roughly linear fashion. This following order will
						also serve as the structure for this report.</p>
					<p>
						Firstly, I began with a <b>review of the existing literature</b> surrounding virtual environments. At
						the
						beginning of the project, I had not settled on the use of VR as a medium, having equally
						considered
						developing a ‘web app’ that would necessarily be presented in screen-space. Hence, this research
						investigated the design of both VR and non-VR virtual environments, providing the theoretical
						and
						contextual underpinnings for my project as well as ultimately influencing my decision to work
						with
						VR. After reviewing the existing literature, I undertook <b>precedent studies of several existing
						virtual spaces</b> to understand and critique the existing state of spatial design in VR.
					</p>
					<p>
						Subsequently, I distilled several <b>parameters and strategies</b> governing the design of virtual
						spaces,
						developing and designing various test cases in VR. Learning the requisite programming skills and
						developing the virtual environment in Unity also took place in parallel to the design and
						research
						work. Several users were then recruited to test and give feedback on the new spatial designs,
						<b>collecting both qualitative and quantitative data</b> that would inform subsequent design choices.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, these inputs and iterations were synthesized to create a set of design parameters and
						possibilities that would serve as the foundation for the next stage of the thesis project –
						designing the overarching generation of these responsive spaces and the user experience within
						them.

						A virtual environment can through the visual dimension of perception, in
						combination with interactive feedback, be helpful in generating immersiveness, understood as the
						sensation of actually being present in an architectural space. A sensation of being present,
						even while one is maintaining a conscious knowledge that this feeling is only an illusion
						created by a digital model. - Hermund et al. 2018

					<h2>Review: Virtual Environments</h2>
					<p>
						From Vitruvius to Le Corbusier and Neufert, architects have sought to design spaces with the
						scale and capabilities of the human body in mind, as well as attempting to express the tectonics
						of material and function in construction. In the same way, <b>the design of virtual spaces ought to
						reflect the different rules</b> that govern both user and environment in the virtual world.
					</p>
					<p>
						Since the late 90s, researchers have called for “a new theory and practice” due to the nature of
						space in VEs being “fundamentally different from the nature of real space”. While the design of
						virtual spaces remains largely on the fringe of architectural practice, the ability to
						experience these spaces in full 3D warrants a re-examination of these fundamental design
						principles.

				<div class="section">
					<h2>Possibilities of Virtual Environments</h2>
					<p>
						For the most part, VEs are differentiated from physical spaces due to their <b>freedom from
						physical and structural constraints</b>. While this affords a significant degree of freedom to
						create almost anything the designer might imagine, the following are the most significant
						implications of VEs from an architectural perspective.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Unless consciously implemented, there is an <b>inherent lack of physical rules</b> such as
							friction, gravity or sound propagation. This affects not just the user experience but also
							the design of spaces, which are not bound by the usual considerations of load-bearing or
							material properties.</li>
						<li>Spaces might be <b>multi-dimensional or non-contiguous</b>, being connected by portals or other
							means of translation, or even completely non-Euclidean in nature.</li>
						<li><b>Scale of the user, objects and environment is unconstrained</b>, allowing for unconventional
							experiences even of conventional spaces at different scales.</li>
						<li><b>Modes of interaction</b> with the environment are explicitly determined by the designer of the
							virtual space – this allows for new modes of experiencing space, either by restricting
							interaction to certain actions such as climbing or modes of movement, or allowing the user
							to perform actions that go beyond the experience of conventional architecture, such as
							creation, manipulation, destruction, and so on.</li>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>Limitations of Virtual Environments</h2>
					<p>
						Despite the seemingly limitless nature of virtual environments, the design of such spaces comes
						with its <b>own set of constraints</b> that govern design choices. These constraints can be seen as
						analogous to the physical and resource considerations that limit architectural design in the
						real world.
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Resource intensiveness</b>, both from a development and user performance perspective, remains a
							key concern. Although the gaming and simulation industry seem to have moved towards ever
							more realistic renderings over the years, such detailed environments require both extensive
							development time as well as advanced hardware to run. VR is especially taxing, requiring two
							separate renders to achieve stereoscopic vision – as such, most current VR environments have
							been designed to minimise graphical complexity.</li>
						<li>No matter how abstract or realistic the environment is designed to be, it ought to be
							designed in a way that<b> allows the user to easily understand the space</b> for (1) navigation and
							(2) interaction. While navigational concerns are similar to those of real-world
							architecture, interaction presents a novel challenge as the visual representation of virtual
							objects might be entirely divorced from their function. Designers need to provide users with
							the affordances necessary to understand the environment, both at a macro and micro scale.
						</li>
						<li><b>Comfort</b> is a concern that applies to most immersive spaces but is especially a concern in VR.
							Especially for users new to the technology, movement in VR can cause discomfort and nausea
							due to the brain’s attempt at processing the artificial spatial visualisation. Spaces and
							interfaces should be designed so that the user feels at ease within the space, both in terms
							of physical discomfort as well as subjective unfamiliarity with the space.</li>

					<h2>Precedent Studies in VR</h2>
					<p>
						In order to gain an understanding of the current state of spatial design in VR, I undertook a
						series of studies of virtual spaces, focusing on archetypal VR spaces that exemplify either (1)
						<b>player navigation in VR space</b>, or (2) <b>peer-to-peer interaction in VR</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Several ‘home base’ environments were studied to gain an understanding of the current state of
						spatial design in VR, especially with regards to <b>navigation and representation</b>. These would be
						the <b>first environments a user encounters</b> when they put on a headset or launch particular apps,
						making it likely that they would have been <b>carefully and intentionally designed to suit the VR
						medium</b>. These spaces are the two default houses for the Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) and SteamVR
						platforms – ‘Cliff House’ and ‘Summit Pavilion’ respectively – as well as the two starting
						‘house’ environments for the social applications AltSpaceVR and VRChat.
					</p>
					<h3>Realism</h3>
					<p>
						Within all of these environments, there is a <b>clear trend towards realism</b> – skeuomorphic details
						help the user acclimatise to the virtual world and show off the immersive capabilities of VR
						technology. In both the WMR and SteamVR houses, photorealistic textures such as concrete and
						timber flooring are used to imitate real-world surfaces, while the latter features architectural
						elements such as window frames and thick structural walls that convey a sense of structural
						realism. In contrast, the home spaces in VRChat and AltSpaceVR are designed in a much more
						cartoonish manner with skewed lines and exaggerated proportions in some cases – however, despite
						the cartoonish aesthetic, the design of both environments features furniture and decorations
						that mimic a real-life environment.
					</p>

					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/Axo_Precedent_SummitPavilion.png"></div>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h3>Spatial Configuration</h3>
					<p>
						In terms of spatial configuration and movement, <b>teleportation is the predominant means of
						locomotion</b> in all cases. Aside from the WMR house, the three other houses feature relatively
						flat plans with no changes in elevation, likely for ease of navigation. In contrast, the WMR
						house has a fairly <b>complex layout with level changes</b> between each section, highlighting the
						variation of spaces and ability to move up and down with teleportation. To the left of the
						starting area, there is even a series of platforms that lead up to the roof – encouraging the
						user to experiment with the unconventional means of experiencing the space. Regardless,
						‘realistic’ features such as stairs appear to serve no purpose in the VR space, as there is no
						need for such mediation to jump between levels.
					</p>
					<h3>Scale of Environments</h3>
					<p>
						Finally, the scale of the environments are mostly designed in accordance with real-world
						proportions, with a few notable exceptions. Boundary walls tend to be lower, as there is no need
						to consider safety at the expense of views or aesthetic preference. <b>Doorways are either wider
						than usual</b> (1.5-2m in the VRChat/AltSpaceVR home), or take the form of wide open apertures such
						as in the WMR and SteamVR houses. This is a key design feature for teleportation, as <b>providing
						line of sight and minimising turns</b> and jumps between two points becomes a key consideration when
						planning movement.

					<h3>SUPERHOT VR: Embracing Teleportation</h3>
					<p>
						In VR, teleportation as a means of locomotion completely changes how we navigate spaces.
						SUPERHOT VR, one of the most acclaimed games for VR, takes place as a series of action vignettes
						that the player has to complete. Particularly relevant is the fact that <b>locomotion is taken out
						of the player’s hands</b>, as the player is automatically teleported to the next location upon
						defeating all the enemies at the previous one. Deliberate positioning of these successive points
						of view allow the player to understand that the scenes are taking place in the same overall
						environment by recognising common environmental features or figures. Here, <b>teleportation is
						embraced as a core feature of the VR experience</b>, with spaces, framed views, and action sequences
						designed around that fact.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition, while the 3D modeled spaces appear to simulate real-life environments, they are
						presented in monochrome white, with enemy figures colored in bright red and interactable objects
						in black. Despite the lack of realistic texturing, the player is clearly able to understand the
						nature of the architectural space via depth perception, while their attention is drawn to the
						key objects of importance. These two design choices demonstrate the potential of designing VR
						environments that go beyond copying real-life environmental conditions.

					<h3>Social Interaction in VR</h3>
					<p>
						As the focus of this project is on designing spaces for multi-user interaction, I also studied
						several spaces in social VR platforms, namely, ‘The Room of the Rain’ and ‘The Black Cat’ in
						VRChat, and the ‘Campfire’ space in AltSpaceVR.
					</p>
					<h3>Realism and Interaction</h3>
					<p>
						In the first two rooms, the design was once again <b>imitative of real-life spaces</b>, featuring
						photorealistic textures and elements such as non-interactable furniture and even a toilet. It is
						possible that users feel more comfortable with analogues of real spaces, even if their use of
						the space is entirely different. This was especially evident in ‘The Black Cat’, a virtual bar
						and restaurant, where <b>users ignored the imitative restaurant seats and bar and instead
						congregated at the virtual ‘mirrors’</b> (allowing the user to observe themselves and others) for
						social activity.
					</p>
					<h3>Audio and Travel</h3>
					<p>
						In all three cases, <b>audio was modulated based on distance</b> from speakers as in real life, meaning
						that people naturally congregated to hear each other better, and moved away from other groups so
						as not to be distracted by other conversations. To access other rooms or instances, users have
						to bring up a 2D interface where they can select another room of their choice, as all the rooms
						are isolated within their own spaces.

					<h2>Parameters for VR Design</h2>
					<p>
						In order to derive a set of general guidelines for spatial design in VR as well as discover
						which aspects of virtual environment design were worth focusing upon, I <b>distilled a number of
						key parameters</b> that could be varied in virtual space. These parameters formed the basis for a
						broad-based investigation into the merits of so-called ‘virtual physics’, testing out which
						variations might be significant and which ones turned out to be redundant. The goal was to
						create a <b>basic set of rules</b> that would guide the eventual generation of environments in the
						interactive platform.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h3>1. Teleportation as primary means of locomotion</h3>
					<p>
						After analysing the various means of locomotion in existing VR applications as well as in
						existing literature, it was understood that while less immersive than other methods,
						teleportation was the preferred means of locomotion due to the minimisation of nausea compared
						to continuous joystick movement. Implementing and testing both modes in a test environment
						proved this to be the case, as such, it was decided that the spatial design would <b>embrace
						teleportation as the primary means of experiencing space</b>.
					</p>
					<h3>2. Standardised gravity</h3>
					<p>
						Although one of the possibilities early on was to play with gravity and disorientation that
						could not be achieved in the real world, a simple test environment where the user was able to
						flip gravity in a room showed the experience to be extremely nauseating in VR. As such, <b>changes
						in gravity or involuntary movement of the user should be minimised</b>.
					</p>
					<h3>3. Human scale</h3>
					<p>
						In order to maintain a sense of immersion and relatability between participants, it was also
						decided that virtual avatars in this environment should maintain a <b>roughly equal proportion</b> to
						each other and to real-life human proportions.
					</p>
				</div>


				<div class="media-section">
					<div class="media-item"><img src="img/RobotNeufert.jpg"></div>
				</div>


				<div class="section">
					<h3>4. Virtual spheres of influence</h3>
					<p>
						Despite the adherence to real-life human scale, the <b>mode of interaction and spheres of influence
						of an avatar in VR differ greatly</b> from real life. Although advanced controllers and suits are
						available, most commercially available headsets only track the user’s head position and their
						two hands, meaning that perception and interaction are <b>centered around these key nodes of the
						virtual avatar</b>. The hands are empowered by the ability to grab objects at a short distance, or
						even interact with objects far away through the use of projected beams, extending the user’s
						reach beyond human proportions.
					</p>
					<p>
						In contrast, other parts of the body become irrelevant as the sphere of influence is centered
						around the upper body. Interaction with objects, sightlines, and other points of interest should
						thus be laid out in easy reach of the user’s sphere of influence.
					</p>
					<h3>5. Width of entrances and apertures</h3>
					<p>
						The lack of collision or a necessarily solid body in the virtual space makes spatial allowances
						a matter of comfort and perception rather than necessity. The key concern regarding the width of
						entrances, however, arises from the need to navigate via teleportation. In most of the case
						studies, having a <b>wide doorway or even an entirely open face</b> allows the user to see and teleport
						with ease, minimising the number of jumps and degree of head turning. By testing various opening
						sizes in the test environment, it was found that an entrance width of about 1.5m is the minimum
						size for comfortable navigation.
					</p>
					<h3>6. Interactable surface height</h3>
					<p>
						While there is little need for virtual furniture such as chairs and beds to be ergonomic since
						the user cannot physically interact with them, the sphere of influence around the upper body
						means that <b>convenient surfaces for placing and observing objects</b> become an integral part of the
						environment. This is further complicated by the fact that VR users can either be seated or
						standing in real life, although the reach provided by the virtual grip allows for some
						additional flexibility. Testing with objects and pedestals of various heights revealed that the
						comfortable height of surfaces was about 700-1100mm for standing users, and 600-800mm for seated
						ones – giving a recommended height of 700-800mm to accommodate both users.
					</p>
					<h3>7. Text size and distance</h3>
					<p>
						Text in virtual reality is generally harder to perceive, due to the constant movement and the
						relatively lower resolution of most currently available headsets, resulting in pixelation known
						as the ‘screen-door effect’. As such, <b>text needs to be clear and legible</b> if it is to be
						presented in 3D. Taking reference from existing work, several font sizes were tested at varying
						distances and it was concluded that a perceived font height of 3.5° was suitable for comfortable
						viewing at any distance.
					</p>
					<h3>8. Audio perception</h3>
					<p>
						At present, existing VR chat rooms largely have <b>audio modulated by proximity</b>, imitating the real
						world and creating a natural incentive for groups to cluster or spread out. While this might be
						ideal for regular conversations, there is an <b>opportunity for audio to be transmitted differently
						in asymmetric situations</b> such as a lecturer speaking to an audience, or a small discussion group
						where everyone wishes to hear each other clearly.

					<h2>Spatial Configuration Testing</h2>
					<p>
						The most promising series of test designs focused on the
						<b>spatial configuration of various rooms</b> and how they affected the user experience of navigation
						and perception of comfort. These form the basis of a more targeted investigation as well as
						shaping the current design proposal for Hyperspatial.
					</p>
					<p>
						Due to the vastly different way in which people experience space through teleportation, it was
						clear from the beginning that <b>traditional architectural features such as doors, stairways and
						corridors do not serve their original purposes in VR</b> – in many cases, they are redundant or even
						obstructive. Thus, I sought to find new ways by which spaces could be composed and aggregated
						that were better suited to this new mode of locomotion. Furthermore, on a larger scale, existing
						social platforms dealt with different ‘rooms’ by having them accessed through menus and lists,
						making for a cumbersome experience in VR. Is there a way to represent and navigate these rooms
						spatially, removing the need for text interfaces as well as offering the user an intuitive
						understanding of the overall space?

				<div class="section">
					<h3>Initial Test Cases</h3>
					<p>After a series of conceptual iterations, three test cases were developed that demonstrated
						different means of navigation:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>A ‘traditional’ layout with walled rooms, doorways, and a central corridor</li>
						<li>An experimental layout, comprising rooms with transparent walls – the user is able to
							appraise all the rooms at a glance, but when they step into a particular room, the walls
							turn solid to give a sense of privacy. This layout has the added benefit of rooms allowing
							entrance/exit from all sides.</li>
						<li>Rooms without walls but separated instead by level differences</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Of these three, the first case highlighted clearly the <b>poor experience of navigating
						conventional spaces in VR</b>, while the latter two offered interesting opportunities to leverage
						the potential of virtual space. The ‘virtual rooms’ in the second case proved to be easily
						navigable, while the (at present) illusion of privacy felt surprisingly comforting despite
						knowing other users could still see in. The last case did not make use of any virtual tricks,
						but demonstrated the ease of navigating between levels in VR and the sense of privacy and
						differentiation afforded by level changes.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>User Testing</h2>
					<p>
						6 participants were recruited for a short experimental survey, in order to verify the hypothesis
						that these non-standard virtual spaces could indeed <b>contribute to user comfort and efficiency of
						navigation</b>. Although the original intention had been to devise tests with multiple users to
						assess the dynamics of peer-to-peer interaction, the limited pool of participants with VR
						headsets and the difficulty of scheduling group meetings between the diverse participants meant
						that the experiments had to be devised for individual participants using character stand-ins to
						represent other users instead. The focus was thus on the <b>quality of spaces and ease of
						navigation</b>, rather than the actual interaction between participants.
					</p>
					<p>
						In addition to the 3 aforementioned test environments, participants were presented with a 4th
						room containing a different ‘levels’ configuration with a central platform overlooking the
						others. In each scenario, participants were tasked to visit 6 groups of characters scattered
						around the room, reporting back two pieces of information – the letter missing from the sequence
						‘ABCDEF’, as well as the letter belonging to a highlighted character. These simple tasks were
						devised as a proxy for actual interaction with other users in a real scenario. After each test,
						participants reported 4 scores along with their answers:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Time taken</li>
						<li>Ease of navigation</li>
						<li>Degree of physical discomfort</li>
						<li>Perceived comfort of rooms as a prospective user</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						The test also included 2 additional mini-scenarios, asking participants to resize a room to
						their liking so as to asses what people perceive to be a ‘comfortable’ room scale for two
						people.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="section">
					<h2>Test Findings</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Scenario 1 was described as awkward, narrow, and difficult to navigate, scoring badly for
							navigation and physical discomfort</li>
						<li>The ‘virtual wall’ scenario scored highest for both navigation and room comfort, followed by
							scenario 4 with the overlooking platform in both categories</li>
						<li>Scenario 4 scored the lowest for physical discomfort</li>
						<li>The ‘virtual walls’ were perceived as the best for a sense of privacy</li>
						<li>Open plan layouts minimise navigational challenges and turning around, which can be
							uncomfortable</li>
						<li>Having an elevated perspective to view rooms is a major aid for navigation</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						Overall, the results showed a fairly strong preference for the dynamics of the ‘virtual wall’
						rooms, as well as the navigational advantages and variety offered by changes in levels. It was
						clear that the ‘traditional’ layout emulating rooms and corridors was not at all suited to the
						VR experience, while the new design suggestions offered promising opportunities – supporting the
						initial hypothesis that going beyond real-life conventions could offer a better user experience.

					<h2>Conclusions</h2>
					<p>
						Based on the user experiment as well as the other investigations into design parameters, I have
						designed a <b>functioning prototype of the final space</b>, incorporating the use of levels, virtual
						rooms, and multi-dimensional spaces.
					</p>
					<p>
						In this design, the <b>landscape is comprised of many different rooms and platforms suited for
						various activities</b> – some are open, some screened when you enter, and some leading to different
						spaces entirely. These rooms are arranged at varying heights but not with too big of a gap,
						allowing users to look across the various rooms and jump easily from one to the next without
						intermediate ‘stairs’. At the highest level, the landscape is crossed by long platforms serving
						as navigational arteries, offering an overview of the spaces on either side.
					</p>
					<p>
						Instead of traditionally enclosed corridors and rooms, it could be that the organisation of
						space in VR inverts such notions of space, favouring open spaces and elevation changes for ease
						of navigation.
					</p>

					<h3>Future Direction</h3>
					<p>
						While the current prototype is functional and integrates many of the lessons learnt from this
						first semester of research, it remains a relatively <b>conceptual model</b>, offering a possible vision
						of what the final platform could look like.
					</p>
					<p>
						The next major stage would be to <b>critically examine the agglomeration of spaces and the nature
						of procedural generation</b> – how exactly should these spaces respond to users? Are some features
						persistent, or is the entire landscape ever changing according to users needs? What governs the
						placement of different modules next to each other, their relative heights, or openness?
					</p>

						<h3>Semester 1</h3>
						<p>Finish comprehensive research of existing literature and conduct study on parameters for
							spatial design. Iterate various spaces and environments, developing guidelines for virtual
							environment design and creating a 'kit-of-parts' approach.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="inner-flex">
						<h3>December Break</h3>
						<p>Focus on platform development and honing skills, build a foundation for final app/virtual
							environment product.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="inner-flex">
						<h3>Semester 2</h3>
						<p>Design work - using the earlier research and design strategies, develop the final platform
							with a focus on user experiences and perception of space. Iterative design process as with a
							typical architectural design project.</p>

					<h2>Dynamic Landscape</h2>
					<p>
						The final product would be a <b>dynamic, responsive space</b>, fully designed for the VR environment
						and taking advantage of its many quirks and opportunities. As in the current design prototype,
						this landscape would comprise a variety of rooms for a variety of social interactions, while at
						the same time being easy to navigate and comfortable to use. By <b>embracing the multidimensional,
						non-physical nature of virtual spaces and the new modes of interaction arising from VR</b>, this
						thesis project hopes to offer a new architectural paradigm for VR space.
